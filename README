Experiments with eBPF
---------------------

This repository implements a simple eBPF interpreter, building
upon github.com/cilium/ebpf library.

An example application (ebpf-capture) captures packets using libpcap
and runs a eBPF program on each packet to decide whether or not to
print it.

To build and run:

  make build
  make run # (capture packets from 'lo' interface and print all icmp packets)

This project requires 'clang' and 'libpcap'. If you're using Nix you can build
and run with: nix-shell --run 'make run'.
