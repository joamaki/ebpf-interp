Experiments with eBPF
---------------------

This repository implements a simple eBPF interpreter, building
upon github.com/cilium/ebpf library.

An example application (ebpf-capture) captures packets using libpcap
and runs a eBPF program on each packet to decide whether or not to
print it. 

To run the example:

  ping 127.0.0.1 > /dev/null & # run ping in background to get some action
  make run                     # capture packets from 'lo' interface and print all icmp packets
  ^C
  kill %1                      # kill ping

This project requires 'clang' and 'libpcap'. If you're using Nix you can build
and run with: nix-shell --run 'make run'.
